# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
# I0011 Warning locally suppressed using disable-msg
# W0142 Used * or * magic* Used when a function or method is called using *args or **kwargs to dispatch arguments.
# R0923 Used when an interface class has not been implemented. PyLint infers that a class is an interface class if the class name ends with Interface (? Is that really the rule ?)
